# Exercise 1
# Every named entity in Ruby has an object_id. This is a unique identifier for that object.
# 
# It is often the case that two different things "look the same", but they can be different objects. 
# The "under the hood" object referred to by a particular named-variable can change depending on what 
# is done to that named-variable.
# 
# In other words, in Ruby everything is an object...but it is not always THE SAME object.
# 
# Predict how the values and object ids will change throughout the flow of the code below:
